# ClarityVote 🗳️

**On-chain governance for Stacks communities**

---

ClarityVote lets any Stacks community create proposals and vote on them fully on-chain. Voting power is weighted by live STX balance — no token to deploy, no snapshot service, no admin key. One contract, one source of truth.

---

## How it works

```
create-proposal(title, description, duration, quorum)
        │
  [voting window open]
        │
   cast-vote(YES=1 / NO=2 / ABSTAIN=3)
   power = tx-sender's STX balance at vote time
        │
  [window closes at end-block]
        │
   finalize-proposal()   ← anyone can call
        │
        ├─ PASSED    yes > no  AND  total ≥ quorum
        ├─ REJECTED  no ≥ yes  OR   quorum not met
        └─ TIED      yes == no AND  quorum met
```

## Block timing

| 3 days | 432 |
| 1 week | 1,008 |
| 2 weeks | 2,016 |

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) — contract testing
- Node.js 18+ — frontend

### Contract tests

```bash
clarinet test
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS and NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=ST...
```

### Deploy to mainnet

```bash
# Encrypt your mnemonic first — never commit plaintext seed phrases
clarinet deployments encrypt

# Then deploy
clarinet deployments apply --mainnet
```

## Frontend stack

- **Next.js 16** — app router
- **@stacks/connect** — wallet auth
- **@stacks/transactions** — contract calls
- **TypeScript** — end to end

Pages:

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/` | Hero, stats, active proposals |
| `/proposals` | Full list with filter + search |
| `/proposals/[id]` | Detail, vote buttons, results |
| `/proposals/new` | Create proposal form |

## Roadmap

- [ ] Real wallet integration (`@stacks/connect` → `store.tsx`)
- [ ] Delegation — assign voting power to another address
- [ ] BNS-gated proposals — only `.btc` names can create
- [ ] Proposal categories and tags
- [ ] Webhook / email notifications on finalization
- [ ] Multi-choice voting beyond YES / NO / ABSTAIN
